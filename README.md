# Introduction
A low power seismic wave collector implemented on Kinetis L ARM cortexM0+ MCU.  
The main process is: a seismic sensor produce analog signal which is captured by ADC of the develop board, then MCU will handle it and send the data by bluetooth to a work station, which will display the wave signal on user interface in real time.

This is a feescale competition project I've done.   
The code provided is the C part running on the ARM MCU, the MATLAB user interface and bluetooth driver.

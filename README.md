# Introduction
A low power seismic wave collector implemented on Kinetis L ARM cortexM0+ MCU.  
The main process is: a seismic sensor generates analog data which is captured by ADC of the develop board, then MCU will handle it and send the data by bluetooth to a work station, which will display the wave signal on a window in real time.

This is a feescale competition project I've done.   
The code provided is the C part running on the ARM MCU.      
The display window is implemented by MATLAB, which is not provided here.
